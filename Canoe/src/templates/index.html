        <p>Since the inception of civilization, humans have cherished water sources and its importance. It is really interesting to know how a life skill turned out to be one of the major played competitive sports today. We all know that two third of the earth is water and most of the early civilizations were at places somewhere around a water source. Some literature say that it was in the Arctic North America were the first Kayaks were built.</p>
        <p>As far as India is concerned Canoe has been the most important means of communication among the ancient tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They used two varieties of canoes – the oldest type of canoe had an outrigger. The other type is one without an outrigger. These canoes were hollowed from a single log of some light wood. The earlier ones were smaller in size. It was only after the acquired iron from wrecked ships at the islands travelling through the Indian Ocean, that they were able to construct bigger canoes. The aboriginals had two models of propelling the canoes – by paddling with small wooden spades in deep water, and by poling in shallow water. While travelling in deep water the canoe was paddled by the occupants who sat facing forward. The steersman used to sit on the seats of the outrigger. The light weight hollowness led to its better buoyancy, and allowed it to cover shorter distance from one island to the other with great speed. The canoe had the possibility of easily overturning in rough sea unless the occupants could maintain the balance with the bodies. But since it was made of light wood it could not sink even when full of water. The aboriginals were easily able to right an overturned canoe and get into it again even in the rough sea. Paddles played a very useful role in the movement of the Andamanese in canoe. The paddles used to be of 125 centimeters, and shaft being 85 centimeters, and the blade 40 centimeters. The diameter of the shaft from the middle used to be 2.6 centimeters. From the middle towards the handle end the shaft was tapered. The blade was given a leaf shape pointed at the apex. There are numerous references in historical documents of the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries of the aboriginals conducting raids on British vessels and penal settlements coming in various canoes. One such famous raid is that of 1859 at Aberdeen, when the Andamanese attacked the penal settlement.</p>
       <p>The above brief gives us an insight as to how this life skill made its presence and importance felt in the day to day life of the humans.</p>
